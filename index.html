            <p>I am an ESL teacher currently looking to become a web developer. I've dabbled with scripting for a
                computer game in the past, so I know that I enjoy both the creativity and the logic that goes into
                coding, as well as the ecstatic "eureka" moments that come when I figure out how to perform a
                particularly daunting task.</p>

            <p>Despite that, however, I would still very much characterize myself as a beginner, both because the only
                coding I've done has been relatively basic, and because it's been more than a year now since I was
                working on scripts for the aforementioned game. Still, the memory of that experience and the prospect of
                a career change have me very excited to learn how to code!</p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy gaming, reading, cycling and hiking, as well as many other things.</p>
